# Go-Playground 🏗️

Welcome to **Go-Playground** — a personal repository documenting my journey of learning the Go programming language. This space is dedicated to daily code and theoretical concepts inspired by the highly acclaimed book:

> **"The Go Programming Language"**  
> _by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan_

## 📘 About the Repository

This repository serves as a structured learning journal and coding workspace, where I apply and reinforce concepts from each chapter of the book. It includes hands-on examples, solved exercises, and personal notes to deepen my understanding of Go’s powerful standard library, concurrent programming model, and core language features.
